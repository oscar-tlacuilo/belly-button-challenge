# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dashboard allows visualization of the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in a selected individual, as well as a bubble chart displaying each sample in more detail.

## Features

- Selection of an individual to explore their biodiversity data.
- Visualization of the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual using a horizontal bar chart.
- Detailed visualization of each microbiome sample using a bubble chart.
- Display of demographic information for the selected individual.
- Automatic update of visualizations and demographic information when selecting a new individual.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (D3.js, Plotly.js)
